The company is going to keep in contact with the customer prior to the arrival of the vessel and the company will take care of all necessary customs and quarantine formalities. Prior to the collection of the vehicle, the remaining 50% of the invoice has to be paid. 

Payment will be automatically requested 5 days prior to the arrival of the vessel and a reminder will be sent upon arrival.
