The validity of the quote is guaranteed for 60 days. 

 
### How to book

Once the client is ready to book his vehicle for shipment, he only has to send previously emailed quotations or call the company if he prefers. 

As soon as a company receives a client order, the company will then email the client an invoice, in which he is required to pay 50% of the shipment fees upfront.


### Arranging Shipment

As soon as the first payment is settled, the company will then confirm the customer booking by email, with the booking reference number and the intended vessel. 

As part of our dedicated first-class service,the client can choose the departure time and terminal drop-off that suits him. For an even easier shipping experience, the company can arrange for the pick up and delivery of the vehicle directly from his door.

If the client is delivering his vehicle to the company's reception center, the company's agent will advise him when the car needs to be sent to the company. If someone from the compnay is collecting the customer's vehicle, then the company's agent  will call the client to ensure that the company have all the car's details and that someone will be present to meet the company's representative.

### Vehicle Reception

Once Company received the customer’s vehicle on company premises, the team will prepare a Vehicle Condition Report which will be emailed to the customer with photographs of the vehicle prior to its safe loading into the container. 

The client has to ensure that the vehicle is cleared of any mud or dirt both inside and outside and that the fuel gauge registers are empty to make sure that any quarantine rules are met. 

The client has to send us also a copy of the registration document together with a copy of the photo page of his passport and any copies of permits or letters of authority received from the application to import.


### After Shipment

Once the vehicle is shipped, the company will arrange for the Bill of Lading to be sent to the client which will enable the release of the vehicle at its destination. 

The company is going to keep in contact with the customer prior to the arrival of the vessel and the company will take care of all necessary customs and quarantine formalities. Prior to the collection of the vehicle, the remaining 50% of the invoice has to be paid. 

Payment will be automatically requested 5 days prior to the arrival of the vessel and a reminder will be sent upon arrival.

The balance needs to be paid without delay so that the vehicle can be cleared through customs, otherwise, storage charges will be incurred.
