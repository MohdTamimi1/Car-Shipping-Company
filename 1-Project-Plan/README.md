## 1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 Project Overview

The project described within this document is a Car  Shipping Container Application designed with the specific goal  to manage the shipment of the car containers loaded on the ships from origin ports, transit and destination ports. The prospective end users will find this application more useful than traditional manual one currently in use because it will facilitate the ways the business and the customers will interact with each. The aim of this project is two fold. First, the preliminary requirements given by the client will be refined into a detailed requirements description which captures real customers' real needs/wants as precisely, concisely and conceptually as possible. Secondly, a prototype will be developed which should demonstrate the key features of the detailed requirement in the real world. This document gives a preliminary plan for how the company aims to achieve the above stated aims. The first section gives an overview, describes project deliverables and itemizes the evolution of this document. Lastly the first section gives the meaning of acronyms that may be encountered in the rest of document and lists references from which guidelines have been drawn. In the second section, the organizational structure of the executing team is given and the third section shows how the team as well as the project will be managed from inception to completion. Technical Processes used are described in Section 4 while the fifth and final section details the work elements, schedule and budget for the project.
